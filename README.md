# IOT-Based-Smart-Door-Lock-System
This project demonstrates an intelligent door locking system controlled remotely via the Internet. The system uses IoT technology to allow users to lock or unlock doors securely using a smartphone or web application. A microcontroller such as ESP32 or Arduino interfaces with a servo motor to physically control the lock.
